# Beyond Chatbots: Intro to Agentic Applications

Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capacity to generate human-seeming language are great at processing large amounts of text in a semantically and contextually meaningful way. While this makes them a great engine inside a chatbot, on their own, they are limited in their capabilities to do exactly that: Taking in text and responding with text.

AI Agents, however, take an LLM’s text generation ability to the next level: Through clever instructions and a specific software harness around the actual LLM, the AI can run code, visit websites, or take any other action that the “agentic” application allows.

In this session, we will go over the high-level concepts of how Agents work, learn about their abilities and limitations, and implement our own agentic application using the Python library LangChain.

This session is designed for anyone interested to learn more about AI Agents. Participants with basic knowledge of Python will get the most out of the code examples.

## Getting started

### Requirements

The requirements for the Python code can be installed using the following command:

```
pip install .
```

If you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), you can instead run:

```
uv sync
```

### Usage

The repo has the following structure:

- `ppt`: The slide deck used in the introduction
- `code`: Python scripts illustrating the main concepts discussed in this workshop
